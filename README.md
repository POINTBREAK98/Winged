A Convenience store Flutter application.

## Project Overview

Retail stores/ shops are the places where they sell goods to individual customers. 

In these stores, the transaction between the customer and store is done by a member of staff.

There may be insufficient staff to complete the transaction which in turn results in a long queue of customers waiting to complete the transaction.

This long queue affects the mentality of the customers in such a way that they have had to wait for a long time even though they have been waiting for a minute long. This will affect the customer loyalty towards the retail store. 

To develop a cross platform mobile application that serves as a Point of Service (POS) on a mobile device which enables the customer to complete the transaction by themselves using the barcode or QR code on the product. 

The objective of this project is to reduce the queuing time of a customer to complete a transaction and also to increase the customer satisfaction and loyalty without wasting time standing in a queue. 

## Modules

User authentication - Authentication is done with Userâ€™s mobile number and location of the user to identify whether he/she is in the store or not. Users are allowed to purchase only if they are in the store's location.

Scanning - Users can use this application as POS that enables them to scan the product and add it to his/her cart which is ready for billing and payment.

Cart management - This allows the user to review or manage by adding/deleting additional quantities of a product in his/her cart before proceeding to payment.

Payment - This module allows the user to make payment for the purchase of products.
Admin - Admin can update the products and stock.
